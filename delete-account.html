  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 4 January 2026</p>

  <p>
    This page explains how users of the <strong>Ansari Traders Grocery</strong>
    mobile application can request deletion of their account and associated data.
  </p>

  <h2>How to request account deletion</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Open the email account that you used to sign in to the app
      (your Google account).
    </li>
    <li>
      Send an email to
      <a href="mailto:alansariapk2025@gmail.com">alansariapk2025@gmail.com</a>
      with the subject line:
      <strong>“Delete my Ansari Traders Grocery account”</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      In the body of the email, include the following information:
      <ul>
        <li>Your full name</li>
        <li>The Google email address you use in the app</li>
        <li>Your phone number (optional, for verification)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      After we verify your request, we will delete or anonymize your account
      and personal data as described below, normally within
      <strong>30 days</strong>.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>What data will be deleted</h2>
  <p>When you request account deletion, we will delete or anonymize, where applicable:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your account profile (name, email address, phone number).</li>
    <li>Your saved delivery addresses and preferences.</li>
    <li>Authentication tokens and active sessions used to sign in to the app.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What data may be retained</h2>
  <p>
    We may retain certain information where we are legally required to do so or
    where we have a legitimate business reason, for example:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Order and transaction records that we must keep for accounting, tax,
      and fraud‑prevention purposes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Server logs and backup copies that will be deleted automatically after
      their normal retention period.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Any retained information is limited to what is necessary and is no longer
    used to provide you with app services once your account has been deleted.
  </p>

  <h2>After your account is deleted</h2>
  <p>
    After we complete deletion of your account:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>You will no longer be able to sign in with your previous account.</li>
    <li>
      You may still install and browse the app as a guest. If you sign in
      again with Google, a new account will be created.
    </li>
  </ul>
