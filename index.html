      </ul>

      <h3>1.2 Information collected automatically</h3>

        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="muted">
        We do not access your contacts, photos or other personal files on your device unless you

      </ul>

      <h2>3. Legal Basis (where applicable)</h2>

        Depending on your location, we may process your personal data based on one or more of the

        <li>Compliance with legal obligations.</li>
        <li>Our legitimate interests (for example, improving the App and preventing fraud), provided those interests are not overridden by your rights.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Sharing of Information</h2>

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Technology and infrastructure providers:</strong> we use third-party services

        </li>
        <li>
          Despite our efforts, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure. We cannot

      </p>

      <h2>10. Third‑Party Links and Services</h2>

      <p>
        The App may contain links to third‑party websites, apps or services (for example, payment or
        delivery partners). We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those third parties.
        We encourage you to review their privacy policies when you visit their services.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

        the App (for example, via a notice or message).
      </p>
      <p>
        Your continued use of the App after any changes become effective means you accept the
        updated Privacy Policy.
